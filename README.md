## About
This image generator automatically groups together neighboring "Destinations" with exactly the same "Locations", nesting them under the same list item. This feature allows users to view their itinerary at a glance.

Given that there is already a previous input of **Location**, the program will assume that the new input(s) for **Destination** or **Meal** are to be nested under that Location.

The image can then be downloaded for offline use.

Code Citations
- The code was entirely built using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools as @ABagram currently has limited knowledge on JavaScript, which could impact the functionality and greatly reduce the quality of the user experience (UX). She thought that she could immediately make use of the website if it were developed to cater to her intended use.
    - The starting code code was made using OpenAI's ChatGPT, while majority of the edits and features (e.g. JavaScript) were primarily made using GitHub Copilot (GPT 4o). The prompts are completely directed by @ABagram.
